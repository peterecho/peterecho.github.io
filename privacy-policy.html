            <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 13, 2025</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Data Collection</h2>
            <p>SongElements does <strong>NOT</strong> collect, transmit, or share any personal data. We have no servers, no analytics, and no tracking of any kind.</p>
            <p>Your privacy is absolute. We cannot see your data because we never receive it.</p>

            <h2>Data Storage</h2>
            <p>All audio recordings, custom titles, icons, tags, and metadata are stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. We do not have access to your recordings, tags, or any other data you create in the app.</p>
            <p>Your recordings never leave your device unless you explicitly choose to share them using iOS's native share functionality.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>SongElements does not use any third-party services, including:</p>
            <p>
                • No analytics services<br>
                • No advertising networks<br>
                • No crash reporting tools<br>
                • No tracking SDKs<br>
                • No cloud storage services
            </p>
            <p>The app is completely self-contained and operates entirely offline.</p>

            <h2>Microphone Permission</h2>
            <p>SongElements requests access to your device's microphone to record audio. This permission is required for the core functionality of the app.</p>
            <p>All recordings captured using the microphone are stored locally on your device and are <strong>never transmitted</strong> to our servers or any third parties.</p>

            <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>You can export recordings from SongElements using iOS's native share sheet. When you share a recording, it is shared directly from your device using iOS's standard sharing mechanisms (Messages, AirDrop, Files app, etc.).</p>
            <p>We do not participate in, monitor, or have any access to these share operations. Sharing is entirely controlled by you and iOS.</p>

            <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
            <p>You have complete control over your data. You can delete individual recordings at any time within the app.</p>
            <p>If you delete the SongElements app from your device, all recordings and associated data are permanently deleted from your device. This action cannot be undone.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>SongElements does not collect any information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age. The app can be used by children without any privacy concerns, as no data ever leaves the device.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>Your recordings are protected by your device's security features, including:</p>
            <p>
                • Device passcode/biometric authentication<br>
                • iOS file system encryption<br>
                • App sandboxing
            </p>
            <p>Since your data never leaves your device, it is never transmitted over networks and cannot be intercepted.</p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>Because we do not collect any data, there is no data for you to request, modify, or delete from our servers. You have complete ownership and control of all data created in the app, which resides solely on your device.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>
            <p>Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or SongElements, please contact:</p>
            <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:privacy@peterecho.com">privacy@peterecho.com</a></p>

            <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
            <p>This privacy policy complies with:</p>
            <p>
                • Apple App Store Review Guidelines<br>
                • California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)<br>
                • General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)<br>
                • Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
            </p>
            <p>Compliance is straightforward because we do not collect any data.</p>
